              <div class="privacy-policy__content"> 
                <p>The Site contains links to third party web sites for the convenience of our users. CML does not endorse any of these third party sites and does not imply any association between CML and those sites. CML does not control these third party web sites and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with these Terms of Use. If you use links to access and use such web sites, you do so at your own risk. CML is not responsible for the contents or availability of any linked sites.

We encourage you to read and understand the terms of use of any linked sites that you visit.

              </div>
              <h3 class="fs-18 c-navyblue fw-semi">State Laws Vary</h3>
              <div class="privacy-policy__content"> 
                <p>CML lawyers are licensed to practice law only within a limited number of states, but we affiliate or form relationships with lawyers throughout the United States. CML may refer prospective clients to other law firms located throughout the country, who form relationships with CML, and are experienced in handling such cases. CML may also undertake legal representation in certain cases, and will affiliate with other legal counsel located throughout the country to provide legal representation. The laws of each State are different. The Site contains information about general or common rules that apply in some states. The Site also contains information about verdicts or settlements in past cases. You cannot assume that the same rules apply, or that the same result would occur, in your state or any particular state. The Statute of Limitations is especially important. Every state has laws called the “statute of limitations” which set a deadline to file a lawsuit. That means that a lawsuit filed too late may be thrown out, regardless of the defendant’s fault or the severity of the injuries. Some states have a two-year period for negligence injury claims; the time period in other states may be longer or shorter. Insurance policies, particularly homeowners insurance, may require that suit be filed within one year of a loss. Some states allow claims against government agencies, but require a written notice very soon after the accident, perhaps within three months. Because investigation and research is needed to identify all possible defendants and theories of recovery, if you have an accident or injury, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible.</p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="fs-18 c-navyblue fw-semi">CML Clients</h3>
              <div class="privacy-policy__content"> 
                <p>Only individuals who have entered into a mutually signed retainer agreement with CML are CML clients (“CML Clients”). Certain portions of the Site designated as such by CML, such as the “My Case” feature of the mobile application, may be available for use only by CML Clients. When CML Clients use such portions of the Site designated by CML to communicate with us pursuant to our representation of a CML Client, we will ensure that any information provided pursuant to such attorney/client relationship may not be shared with third parties except as is done with such precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the relevant information and any attorney/client privilege as may attach to such information. CML takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect the information that we collect.</p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="fs-18 c-navyblue fw-semi">Legal and Ethical Requirements</h3>
              <div class="privacy-policy__content"> 
                <p>CML has tried to comply with all legal and ethical requirements in compiling the Site. We welcome comments about our compliance with the applicable rules and will update the Site as warranted, upon learning of any new or different requirements. To the extent that the professional responsibility rules of any jurisdiction require us to designate a principal office or an attorney responsible for the Site, CML designates its office in 300 Cadman Plaza W, 12th floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201, and attorney Daniel Cohen.</p>

You understand that by agreeing to arbitration as a mechanism to resolve all controversies, disputes and claims between us, you are waiving certain rights, including the right to bring an action in court, the right to a jury trial, the right to broad discovery, and the right to an appeal. You understand that in the context of arbitration, a case is decided by an arbitrator (one or more), not by a judge or a jury.</p>
